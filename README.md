PMCalendar
==========

Yet another calendar component for iOS. Compatible with iOS 4.0 (iPhone &amp; iPad) and higher.

UI is inspired by [ocrickard](https://github.com/ocrickard)'s [OCCalendarController](https://github.com/ocrickard/OCCalendar). It's quite good component, but doesn't have some useful features which I wanted to see. Unfortunately [OCCalendarController](https://github.com/ocrickard/OCCalendar) very hard to maintain, so I decided to make my own implementation.

What you see here is an alpha version, quite basic implementation of a calendar component.
